This is the pygraph library available here :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pynetwork/
But this is binding with PyQt4.
The cartesianPlot class in the eponym file will create a QtGui.Widget and a QtGui.QPainter in it.
If you want to use it alone you need to create a QApp first. The cartesianPlot.pyw file has exemples.
